                <h5>Critical Bugs</h5>
                <p>This means the defect is a show stopper with high potential damages and has no workaround to avoid the defect. An example could be the application does not launch at all and causes the operating system to shut down. This requires immediate attention and action and fix.</p>

                <h5>Serious Bugs</h5>
                <p>This means that some major functionalities of the applications are either missing or do not work and there is no workaround. Example, an image viewing application cannot read some common image formats.</p>

                <h5>Normal Bugs</h5>
                <p>This means that some major functionality do not work, but, a workaround exists to be used as a temporary solution.</p>

                <h5>Cosmetic/Enhancements</h5>
                <p>This means that the failure causes inconvenience and annoyance. Example can be that there is a pop-up message every 15 minutes, or you always have to click twice on a button to perform the action.</p>

                <h5>Suggestions</h5>
                <p>This is not normally a defect and a suggestion to improve a functionality. This can be GUI or viewing preferences.</p>
